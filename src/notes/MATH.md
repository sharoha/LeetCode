1.  Luca's theorem:  
 States that number of binomial coefficients `C(n,k)` which are not divisible by prime `p`, is 
   ```(a1+1)*(a2+1)*..(am+1)```  
  where `ai` is ith digit of `n` in `p-ary` numeral system.   
  Example:  
  `p=3, n=7 dec=21 Result=(2+1)*(1+1)=6`  
   `7th row` of Pascal triangle is `1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1`, it contains `6` coefficients not    divisible by `3`, and the two remaining are divisible by 3
